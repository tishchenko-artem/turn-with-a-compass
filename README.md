You have an 8-wind compass.

You receive the direction you are <code>facing</code> (one of the 8 directions: <code>N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW</code>) and a certain degree to <code>turn</code> (a multiple of 45, between -1080 and 1080); positive means clockwise, and negative means counter-clockwise.

Return the direction you will face after the turn.

Examples

<code>"S",  180  -->  "N"</code>

<code>"SE", -45  -->  "E"</code>

<code>"W",  495  -->  "NE"</code>
